            <h4>Introduction:</h4>
            <h5>Hello,</h5>
            <h5 class = "paragraph">
                I'm an international student from Lebanon and currently a senior. I lived in San Francisco, CA for the first three years of my time at SFSU until COVID-19 broke out. 
                Before the start of the Spring 2020 semester, I relocated to Dubai, UAE to be closer to my family. I have been interested in computers since I was young and have always 
                been passionate about the Sciences, particularly Mathmatics, Physics, and Chemistery. I believe it is this fascination that inspired me to pursue a career in Computer
                Science. I am uncertain about what field of CS I will find myself in; however, I hope to continue my education to achieve a Masters degree in Computer and Electrical
                Engineering to perhaps work on processors or other hardware. I'm also passionate about cryptography, so I consider that to be another viable career path given that I 
                build the required foundation in Mathematics. As for programming languages, my favorites include C, C++, and JavaScript.
            </h5>
            <h5 class = "paragraph">
                Besides my background and ambitions in Computer Science, I love to read books on philosophy, political-economic theory, and history. I enjoy programming, playing chess,
                and going on adventures in my free time. I am fluent in English and Arabic; French is my third language which I can speak with limitations. I have had the privledge of 
                living in 3 different countries and visiting over 25 others across 6 continents.
